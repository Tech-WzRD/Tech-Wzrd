Hey wazzup Tech WzRD here!
Honestly, I am new to this whole GitHub experience and really excited about all of the possibilities it has for my future in software development!! 
Who knows I might actually like it and might even become good at writing code... Hopefully one day!!!
Till then I 'll try to dive into it and mess with it a bit just to get a hang of it.
Also, it would be nice to meet developers, newbies or experts, and just have a chat to get to know each other, exchange knowledge and even working together on a project!
That being said to close this README.md file, keep on smiling and never stop trying for the best ;)

P.S. If you have read till here do drop a message and I 'll get to you sooner or later✌️

Much Love,
Tech-WzRD
